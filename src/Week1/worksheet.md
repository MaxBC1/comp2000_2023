# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  <!-- Both of these websites are cloud based coding sites where users can upload, clone, edit and share code files/repositories.
  The main differnce between the websites is that bitbucket is designed for more private uploads where as git is designed more around a public setting. Git users can use private repos but they are capped out at 3 users per private repos. 
  For the setting of class and teaching, git is better for as it allows plenty of with public access. -->

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  <!-- Matthew Roberts, 08/18/22 -->
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  <!-- Jon Mountjoy, 11/08/14 -->
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  <!-- Last = DavePearce, 11/08/22
  First =  zmthy, 15/05/2011-->

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  <!--  "For the purpose of this action, a repository is considered inactive if it has not had a push in a configurable amount of days."
  https://github.com/github/stale-repos
  
  In both cases i would assume both repos are inactive as there has not been any commits to either in just under a year.
  
  The most likely option for the the repos becoming inactive is that they have been completed in terms of code being updated or there may have been high rated repos that cover a similar or the same topic that attracts all the traffic. -->
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  <!-- Unsure about Bit file 
  Git had 696 cahnges to build.num -->

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
