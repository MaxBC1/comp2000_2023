# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  <!-- Both of these websites are cloud based coding sites where users can upload, clone, edit and share code files/repositories.
  The main differnce between the websites is that bitbucket is designed for more private uploads where as git is designed more around a public setting. Git users can use private repos but they are capped out at 3 users per private repos. 
  For the setting of class and teaching, git is better for as it allows plenty of with public access. -->

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  <!--  -->
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened?
  * 🤔 Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
